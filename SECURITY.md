# TVC Security Documentation

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- All API keys and sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Separate production and development configurations

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Sequence Theory SSO integration for user authentication
- JWT token-based session management
- API key validation for backend requests
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs validated and sanitized
- Email validation with proper regex patterns
- Amount validation for deposits
- Transaction hash validation
- XSS prevention through input sanitization

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Client-side rate limiting for API requests
- Backend rate limiting (1000 requests/hour per API key)
- Automatic cleanup of rate limit entries

### 5. Blockchain Security
- Real USDC transactions instead of mock/demo functions
- Balance verification before transactions
- Transaction receipt validation
- Proper error handling for failed transactions

### 6. Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User-specific data access policies
- Proper indexing for performance and security
- Audit logging for all API access

### 7. Content Security Policy
- CSP headers implemented via SecurityHeaders component
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Secure connection requirements

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Replace all placeholder API keys with production values
- [ ] Configure vault contract address for mainnet
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for all endpoints
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policies
- [ ] Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Review and audit all smart contract interactions
- [ ] Implement proper key management for production secrets
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning

## Security Incident Response

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Disable affected API keys
   - Pause smart contract operations if necessary
   - Notify security team and stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Review access logs and audit trails
   - Identify scope and impact of incident
   - Document findings and timeline

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes and security patches
   - Restore services with enhanced monitoring
   - Communicate with affected users

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement additional preventive measures
